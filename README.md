# Give Back

## User Story
As a person who cares about good causes, 
I want to be able to search for charitable organizations that are recommended by others, as well as post my own, 
so that I can raise awareness and increase donations for the causes I care most about.


## Description
This is a MERN stack web application that allows users to post the charitable organizations that they care about most and want to raise awareness for.  Our goal was to make this a much more personal experience for users, versus just your typical search engine.  Users are also able to search through otherâ€™s recommendations, comment on the organizations posted, and are offered a quick and simple way to donate to each of them.

**Comment functionality is set up, but not fully functional at this time.  This was included in our "future development ideas".


## Technologies Used
- MongoDB & Mongoose ODM (database)
- GraphQL, Apollo Client, Node.js & Express.js server (back-end)
- React & Material-UI Component Library (front-end)
- JSON Web Tokens (authentication)
- Stripe API (for donations)
- Heroku (to deploy)
